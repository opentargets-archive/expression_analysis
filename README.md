## Analysis of expression data
This repo contains some exploratory data analysis of the RNA expression data. The file `expression.txt` is identical to `exp_summary_NormCounts_genes.txt`, except that it has `gene` added to the first line, so that `pandas.DataFrame` can more easily read it in.

## Run as a commandline
Execute (it needs _unix_ bash) `rna_expression_analysis_with_blueprint2.sh` and you will get it computed on the terminal.
